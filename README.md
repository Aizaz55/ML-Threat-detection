# 🚀 Quick Start
Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cicids2017-threat-detection.git
cd cicids2017-threat-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Basic Usage
pythonfrom src.model_trainer import CICIDSThreatDetector
import pandas as pd

# Load your trained model
detector = CICIDSThreatDetector()
detector.load_model('models/cicids_threat_model.pkl')

# Analyze network traffic
network_data = pd.read_csv('your_network_data.csv')
threats = detector.predict_threats(network_data)

# View results
for threat in threats:
    print(f"Threat: {threat['type']} - Confidence: {threat['confidence']:.2%}")
Training Your Own Model
bash# Train on CICIDS2017 dataset
python main.py --data_path "path/to/cicids2017" --train --save_model
